#contaminated data
1.I have removed the column names 'default' which contains all sort of text and some queries. 
  This can be eliminated by checking the leakage in ETL and pipeline.

2.In column 'decreased_indicator' I have replace all the N to readable word "No" and y with"YES"
3.In the column 'DOB' found a year less than 1899 which is usaual date are calculated from 
1899 december 31------1
1900 january-----2
.
.
.
so on
and from date 1843-2021 it will be around 157 years which is not possible for a person to have
a age of 157 so it has to be replaced 1843 with 1943.

3.centralised the column 'gender' only with female and male from other values 
such as 'f','Femal','m'.


#In customerAddress sheet 

In the address column we have extra 3 rows (4003) and count is 4000 in the demographics sheet
which means we are have missing customers adresss.
validating the data  I found that customerid 3,10,22,23 are missing  which may be related 
to the extra three rows we have.
we have to perform further investigation to confirm the lost address.


In the state replaced the state with full names
NSW with new south wales
QLD with queensland
VIC vivtoria


Strange thing found in the address column 
'64 macpherson juction' is having both staes new south wales and Queensland
'3 mariners cove terracce' is in both Victoria and New South wales


#In trasactions sheet


The column product_first_sold contains date as number covnverted them to date 
using custom format


#In newcustomers list

In the state replaced the state with full names
NSW with new south wales
QLD with queensland
VIC vivtoria

Corrected many data type error such as column having int 
value represented as text such as data in the postcode, property valuation
and past_3_years_bike_related_purchases.


#In the sheet newcustomerlist and customersDemographic
Calculated the age using
=year(now())-year(cell)
then used this to categories into age category

=IF(AND(F2>19,F2<=35),"(19-35)years",IF(AND(F2>35,F2<=60),"(36-60)years",IF(AND(F2>60,F2<90),"retired","none")))
min age is=19
max age is=91
from the age column
none is for the value 0 where the DOB are missing
